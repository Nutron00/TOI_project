    <p>Now when we have understood the data we will focus on extracting it.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>We will first import the basic libraries.</li>
        <image src="images/dataExtraction/import1.png"></image>
        <li>Now we will use the request library to extract the webpage
            and soup library to read that webpage.</li>
        <image src="images/dataExtraction/import2.png"></image>
        <li>Every paragraph has same class tag so we will contain those into a 
            variable and find the required data from there. I will now provide the 
            full code. 
        </li>
        <image src="images/dataExtraction/import3.png"></image>
        <li>In the above code we created three variables datetime,city and description
            and created a dataframe using pandas library. The range of the page is upto 22400 I ran it from 0.
        </li>
        <li>This dataframe (df1) will be added to the previous dataframe that I created with range less than the shown.
            Hence we will get the below dataframe.
        </li>

        <li>Now we will save this data into a csv file and the next part is data cleaning.</li>
